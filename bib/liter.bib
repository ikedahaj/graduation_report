@article{Widder1989,
abstract = {We consider the motion of a Brownian particle in a medium with inhomogeneous temperature in the presence of an external potential. We start from the Klein-Kramers equation; in this equation a thermophoretic force, proportional to the temperature gradient, should in general be included to obtain a correct description of thermodiffusion effects in the hydrodynamic stage of the evolution. With the Chapman-Enskog method we derive the correct form for the Smoluchowski equation, which reduces to van Kampen's recent result in the absence of thermophoretic forces. We also give the first correction to this equation caused by deviations from local thermal equilibrium. For the system considered, such deviations persist even in the steady state. {¥textcopyright} 1989.},

@article{Stolovitzky1998,
abstract = {The stationary distribution of a dilute gas of Brownian particles in an inhomogeneous thermal bath and in the presence of a force field is considered. Our aim is to understand the dynamics of the Brownian particles in cases when inertial effects are non-negligible and in conditions of zero mass current. We restrict the analysis to the one-dimensional case. Beyond the requirement that there is no mass transport, the temperature and force fields are arbitrary. The statistical description of this processes is governed by the Kramers equation, whose solution we find as an expansion in powers of the inverse of the friction coefficient. The resulting expressions for the position and velocity distribution, heat flux, etc., are tested against numerical simulations of the corresponding Langevin equation. We show that the appropriate interpretation of the Langevin equations, as inertia becomes less important (overdamped limit), is the It{¥^{o}} interpretation. For sufficiently large friction, the heat flux is linear in the temperature gradient, and the system can be analyzed using the tools of irreversible thermodynamics. We show that the entropy production is never negative, vanishing only at thermodynamic equilibrium.},
